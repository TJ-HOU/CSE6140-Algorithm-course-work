# CSE6140-course-work
Include all the code I designed for CSE6140 including all the homework problems and the projects. 

MST: 
1, Construct a weighted undirected graph from a file of vertices and edges
2, Implemented Prim's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph
3, Compute the total weight of the MST
4, Recompute the total weight of the MST after adding extra edges
