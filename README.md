# CSE6140-course-work
Include all the homework problems and projects for CSE 6140 Algorithm. 

## HW1 [report](https://github.com/sliao7/CSE6140-Algorithm-course-work/blob/master/HW1/report.pdf)
### 1. Big-O time Complexity
### 2. Algorithm Design and Complexity Analysis (Box Throwing)
### 3. Greedy - Points on a 2D plane

* Designed a Greedy algorithm that uses a minimum number of disks centered on a line to cover all n distinct points on 2D plane

* Proved the optimality of the Greedy algorithm by induction

* Space complexity: O(n)

* Time complexity: O(n log n)

### 4. Greedy - Why is the pool always so busy anyway?

* Designed a Greedy algorithm to produce a schedule of n athletes for the "Tech Swim Run Bike" Triathalon program at Georgia Tech to minimize the completion time

* Proved the optimality of the Greedy algorithm by an exchange argument

* Space complexity: O(n)

* Time complexity: O(n log n)

## HW2 [report](https://github.com/sliao7/CSE6140-Algorithm-course-work/blob/master/HW2/report.pdf)
### 1. Dynamic Programming: Atlanta MARTA
* Designed a DP algorithm to find an n days purchase plan that minimizes the amount of money for a commuting plan

* Time and space complexity O(n)

### 2. Dynamic Programming: Buy More
* Designed a DP algorithm to find an ordering plan for a manager of a consumer-electronic store to meet the n monthly demands with an inventory that can keep up to I computers, whilst minimizing the cost 

* Time and space complexity: O(nI) 

### 3. Minimum Spanning Tree [code](https://github.com/sliao7/CSE6140-Algorithm-course-work/tree/master/HW2/MST)

* Construct a weighted undirected graph from a file of vertices and edges
* Implemented Prim's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph
* Compute the total weight of the MST
* Recompute the total weight of the MST after adding extra edges
