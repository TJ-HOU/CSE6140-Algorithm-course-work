# CSE6140-course-work
Include all the homework problems and projects for CSE 6140 Algorithm. 

## [HW1](https://github.com/sliao7/CSE6140-Algorithm-course-work/blob/master/HW1/report.pdf)
1. Big-O time Complexity
2. Algorithm Design and Complexity Analysis (Box Throwing)
3. Greedy - Points on a 2D plane

MST: 
1, Construct a weighted undirected graph from a file of vertices and edges
2, Implemented Prim's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph
3, Compute the total weight of the MST
4, Recompute the total weight of the MST after adding extra edges
